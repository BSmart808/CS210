8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission Project Two

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- In this project we were tasked to create a program that acted as an investment calculator. We were to build the program to take four inputs: The initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, the annual interest amount, and the number of years you wanted to invest.
  
What did you do particularly well?
- I felt like I did particularly well with writing the code. The classes and methods used were decently built and got the task at hand done.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I feel like I could have done better with how the code looks. My biggest issue was trying to create the "GUI" for the code and even though it looks fine when you run it it definitely looks like spaghetti in the actual files itself.
- If I could go back and structure the display code better it would make the code less cluttered and messy looking
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The most challenging part of the code was the math in the InvestmentMath.cpp file. I struggled multiple times with making sure the calculated interest code was working properly and correctly outputing the right numbers. It took a while to come up with the nested for loop solution.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- This project helped a lot with understanding the concept of Object Oriented Programming. It was an Aha moment for me when I finished writing the program and helped me understand the concept of it fully.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- The code can definitely be built upon and is easy to understand. With the inline comments I added I think most people, if not everyone, can understand the core concept of what the code is trying to do.
